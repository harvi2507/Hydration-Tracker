# Hydration-Tracker

“Stay hydrated, stay healthy — personalized water tracking at your fingertips.”

Hydration Tracker is a smart web app that helps users stay healthy by monitoring daily water intake. Instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach, it sets personalized hydration goals based on each user’s weight and physical activity level, ensuring that recommendations are accurate and meaningful.

Users can log their water consumption throughout the day, and the app tracks progress in real time. A simple and engaging interface with progress indicators and visual charts motivates users to complete their daily hydration goals. The app transforms a basic health necessity into an interactive and rewarding experience.

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Hydration Tracker is lightweight, responsive, and easy to use on any device. It is designed for everyone—from athletes to desk workers—making hydration accessible and fun. Future improvements can include reminder notifications, user accounts, and long-term tracking with backend integration.

By combining personalization, simplicity, and motivation, Hydration Tracker acts as a daily health companion, encouraging consistent water intake and promoting overall well-being.
